# Yu-gi-oh Combo Planner
Combo planner for Yu-gi-oh! Trading Card Came, has card search can drag-n-drop cards for saving combo, into the browser cache maybe, haven't even started the project yet.

# Why this?
 Since the Master duel came out, I got the urge to try hard and be a pro duelist this time. But I sucked and couldn't memorize a single combo except normal summon Aleister.
 
 This shitty web app can do it for me, taking note of of combo and specific way to cycle and get rid of specific annoying opp's cards is nice, i think (especially the f*king golden retard lord, or that p*ssy striker chick).

 Anyway, since there are numerous deck planner around, not to mention the Master Duel's one itself, i don't want to create one. Nor the combo tester, since I don't know a thing about rulings, maybe you can help me about that? PLease raise an issue or clone the repos,  add that fucntion for me bro.

# Credit
ME and ME, thank me very much for bringing me comfort, memorizing these shite is suck a dick move, how do I even do that if I can't even memorize my homework???

and YOU of course, for choosing to use this shitty app, or if you can add the combo testing function, i will head over and we can have a coffee togheter.
